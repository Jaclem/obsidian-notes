Return saves the value of the function wherever we call the function from

For instance when we return a function we would typically have a variable to save the value somewhere

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}

// our return allows us to save the value of the add() function in the variable sum
let sum = add(1 + 2)
```

return in essence saves the value of whatever value needs to be saved within the function and can be used later if saved inside a variable.

The LCO principle is the basically making sure that individual objects can stand alone as much as possible. 

**Tightly coupled** objects are objects that rely so heavily on each other that removing or changing one will mean that you have to completely change another one

**Example:** 
If we were writing a game and wanted to completely change how the User Interface worked, we should be able to do that without completely reworking the game logic.

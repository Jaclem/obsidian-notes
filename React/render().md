The only thing we need to know for now is that every React class component needs a render function, which returns _one_ top-level JSX element.

```javascript
// GOOD
render() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello world</h1>
            <h2>Welcome to my React page!</h2>
        </div>
    )
}
```
